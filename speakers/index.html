<p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/firojalam/">Firoj Alam</a> is a Scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), HBKU. He received his PhD from the University of Trento, Italy, and has been working for more than ten years in Artificial Intelligence, Deep/machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Social media content, Image Processing, and Conversation Analysis. His current research interest includes LLMs, fact-checking, multimodal propaganda detection in multiple languages. He previously presented tutorials at WWW-2022 and WSDM-2022 on the topic of “Fact-Checking, Fake News, Propaganda, And Media Bias”. He was a co-organizer of different shared tasks CheckThat! 2020-2024 at CLEF, SemEval-2021 task 6 (propaganda detection in memes), SemEval-2024 task (multilingual detection of persuasion techniques in memes), WANLP shared task (2022-2023) and the NLP4IF-2021 shared task. He is also a co-organizer of the BLP-2023 workshop, which is co-located with EMNLP-2023.

<p><a href="http://shammur.one/">Shammur Absar Chowdhury</a> specializes in designing Conversational AI models, primarily addressing complex challenges such as multispeaker interactions, nuanced multilingual and dialect variations, and code-switching, among various other intricate conversational dynamics. She is currently the leading (PI) on the QVoice project, which empowers speakers—both native and non-native of all ages alike—to learn spoken Arabic. The QVoice project leverages adaptive speech technologies and multimodal feedback modules as its underlying technologies. She authored over 60 peer-reviewed publications in top-tier conferences and journals and played an active role in the research community by organizing shared tasks, challenges, and workshops, as well as serving on the committees of top-tier conferences and special interest groups. She co-founded the Bangla Language Processing Community and MyVoice, a crowdsourced platform, designed to bridge the gaps between standard and dialectal Arabic resources..
